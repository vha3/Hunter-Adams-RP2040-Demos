/* Introduction
 * ------------
 * SD and MMC cards support a number of interfaces, but common to them all
 * is one based on SPI. Since we already have the mbed SPI Interface, it will
 * be used for SD cards.
 *
 * The main reference I'm using is Chapter 7, "SPI Mode" of:
 *  http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/Simplified_Physical_Layer_Spec.pdf
 *
 * SPI Startup
 * -----------
 * The SD card powers up in SD mode. The start-up procedure is complicated
 * by the requirement to support older SDCards in a backwards compatible
 * way with the new higher capacity variants SDHC and SDHC.
 *
 * The following figures from the specification with associated text describe
 * the SPI mode initialisation process:
 *  - Figure 7-1: SD Memory Card State Diagram (SPI mode)
 *  - Figure 7-2: SPI Mode Initialization Flow
 *
 * Firstly, a low initial clock should be selected (in the range of 100-
 * 400kHZ). After initialisation has been completed, the switch to a
 * higher clock speed can be made (e.g. 1MHz). Newer cards will support
 * higher speeds than the default _transfer_sck defined here.
 *
 * Next, note the following from the SDCard specification (note to
 * Figure 7-1):
 *
 *  In any of the cases CMD1 is not recommended because it may be difficult for
 * the host to distinguish between MultiMediaCard and SD Memory Card
 *
 * Hence CMD1 is not used for the initialisation sequence.
 *
 * The SPI interface mode is selected by asserting CS low and sending the
 * reset command (CMD0). The card will respond with a (R1) response.
 * In practice many cards initially respond with 0xff or invalid data
 * which is ignored. Data is read until a valid response is received
 * or the number of re-reads has exceeded a maximim count. If a valid
 * response is not received then the CMD0 can be retried. This
 * has been found to successfully initialise cards where the SPI master
 * (on MCU) has been reset but the SDCard has not, so the first
 * CMD0 may be lost.
 *
 * CMD8 is optionally sent to determine the voltage range supported, and
 * indirectly determine whether it is a version 1.x SD/non-SD card or
 * version 2.x. I'll just ignore this for now.
 *
 * ACMD41 is repeatedly issued to initialise the card, until "in idle"
 * (bit 0) of the R1 response goes to '0', indicating it is initialised.
 *
 * You should also indicate whether the host supports High Capicity cards,
 * and check whether the card is high capacity - i'll also ignore this.
 *
 * SPI Protocol
 * ------------
 * The SD SPI protocol is based on transactions made up of 8-bit words, with
 * the host starting every bus transaction by asserting the CS signal low. The
 * card always responds to commands, data blocks and errors.
 *
 * The protocol supports a CRC, but by default it is off (except for the
 * first reset CMD0, where the CRC can just be pre-calculated, and CMD8)
 * I'll leave the CRC off I think!
 *
 * Standard capacity cards have variable data block sizes, whereas High
 * Capacity cards fix the size of data block to 512 bytes. I'll therefore
 * just always use the Standard Capacity cards with a block size of 512 bytes.
 * This is set with CMD16.
 *
 * You can read and write single blocks (CMD17, CMD25) or multiple blocks
 * (CMD18, CMD25). For simplicity, I'll just use single block accesses. When
 * the card gets a read command, it responds with a response token, and then
 * a data token or an error.
 *
 * SPI Command Format
 * ------------------
 * Commands are 6-bytes long, containing the command, 32-bit argument, and CRC.
 *
 * +---------------+------------+------------+-----------+----------+--------------+
 * | 01 | cmd[5:0] | arg[31:24] | arg[23:16] | arg[15:8] | arg[7:0] | crc[6:0] |
 * 1 |
 * +---------------+------------+------------+-----------+----------+--------------+
 *
 * As I'm not using CRC, I can fix that byte to what is needed for CMD0 (0x95)
 *
 * All Application Specific commands shall be preceded with APP_CMD (CMD55).
 *
 * SPI Response Format
 * -------------------
 * The main response format (R1) is a status byte (normally zero). Key flags:
 *  idle - 1 if the card is in an idle state/initialising
 *  cmd  - 1 if an illegal command code was detected
 *
 *    +-------------------------------------------------+
 * R1 | 0 | arg | addr | seq | crc | cmd | erase | idle |
 *    +-------------------------------------------------+
 *
 * R1b is the same, except it is followed by a busy signal (zeros) until
 * the first non-zero byte when it is ready again.
 *
 * Data Response Token
 * -------------------
 * Every data block written to the card is acknowledged by a byte
 * response token
 *
 * +----------------------+
 * | xxx | 0 | status | 1 |
 * +----------------------+
 *              010 - OK!
 *              101 - CRC Error
 *              110 - Write Error
 *
 * Single Block Read and Write
 * ---------------------------
 *
 * Block transfers have a byte header, followed by the data, followed
 * by a 16-bit CRC. In our case, the data will always be 512 bytes.
 *
 * +------+---------+---------+- -  - -+---------+-----------+----------+
 * | 0xFE | data[0] | data[1] |        | data[n] | crc[15:8] | crc[7:0] |
 * +------+---------+---------+- -  - -+---------+-----------+----------+
